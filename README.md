# album_art_genre_classification

### Introduction
Music is a major part of our daily lives and culture, and album art sets the tone for songs and merchandise. We wanted to see if we could predict an album's genre using the album cover art. We wanted to do this because it has not been researched much, album genre classification has mostly been done in research with audio, album name, and lyrics. Very few people ahve researched if you can predict the album genre based on the album art alone. We were inspired to do this work when we noticed that many large artists such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift have progression in album art corresponding to a shift in music genre.

## Main Idea 
We want to create a Convolutional Neural Network to predict which genre of music an album belongs to based on an image of its album art.
